# **Temporal and spatial analysis of earthquakes in Italy in the last century**

Italy lies at the boundary of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates, and both plates move and smash
into each other releasing a lot of energy and making Italy a seismically active zone, especially central
Italy (mountain range). The last main earthquake was the MW 6.3 quake that struck Lâ€™Aquila (Abruzzo)
in the early morning of April 6, 2009: 297 people were killed, over 1,000 injured, 66,000 made homeless,
and many thousands of buildings were destroyed or damaged. In order to better study the relationship between 
the occurrence of earthquakes and the geological structure, we present the temporal and
spatial characteristics of earthquakes, explore the temporal and spatial rules of earthquake disasters and
determine the seismically active regions in Italy.
We investigate and analyze the earthquakes data coming from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program
with the magnitude greater than MW 5.0 that occurred in Italy and surrounding countries during the
last hundred years: from 1925 to 2025.
